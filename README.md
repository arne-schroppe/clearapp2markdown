# clearapp2markdown
A small script to extract tasks from [Clear's](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clear-todos/id493136154) database to a markdown file.

For the macOS version of Clear you can find the database file under

`~/Library/Containers/com.realmacsoftware.clear.mac/Data/Library/Application\ Support/com.realmacsoftware.clear.mac/LocalTasks.sqlite`

Getting the database for the iOS version of Clear doesn't seem to be possible anymore
(unless you're running an old version of iOS that still allows access through apps like iExplorer).

Note also, that Clear has its own backup solution. I prefer plain text, however.
